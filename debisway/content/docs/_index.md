Instructions and list of applications after Debian (Stable) Standard System Utilities installed.  
{{% /pageinfo %}}

This documentation developed primarily to have structured wiki to my operation system because things are forgotten over time.  
But hope people will find something useful here.

# Who might find this useful
A person who wants a stable, fast, simple, and minimalistic working environment. Someone who is comfortable working in Linux, terminals, and ready to work with a Tiling Window Manager (Sway).


# Motivation 
The OS must be configurable and well-documented as much as possible to make professionals comfortable to work with.
