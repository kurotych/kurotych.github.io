My article about reconstructing foreign keys (or find missed ones) in SQL databases using [sqlant](https://github.com/kurotych/sqlant)
and LLMs was published in the [csecurity.kubg.edu.ua](https://csecurity.kubg.edu.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/847/724)
journal.  
It could be a good idea to include this approach in a utility that works with databases.
