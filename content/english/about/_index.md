### My engineering philosophy 
- **I‚Äôm not restricted by my preferences.** There is no ideal programming language or unified tech stack to solve all problems. But there are some technologies that I‚Äôd like to work with and some that I would not.
- I believe that good planning and prototyping usually save software development time a lot. Even (or especially) if it is a very early startup. So, **firstly think, investigate, and communicate only then code**.
- Documentation is a must-have to keep informed all development participants. 
The phrase *Code should be self-documenting* is about code readability not about documentation.
- I prefer to use ‚ÄúDiagrams as Code‚Äù (**PlantUML**, Mermaid, etc) solutions to others.

### A bit about my preferences
I use **GNU/Linux** both for work and at home for the whole of my professional carrier.
Last several years I use open-source software only (except for some drivers).
I didn't touch Windows for years and don't what to start.

Currently, my favorite language to build something more than simple scripts is **Rust** (before it was C and C++).  
For scripting writing, I prefer **Python** or **Bash**.

Since I use **Neovim** as IDE I started to use **Lua** to build plugins for it.

**I'm not fond** of javascript and typescript and prefer to work with them as little as possible.
