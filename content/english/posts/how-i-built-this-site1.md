### Technologies

This site hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) plus [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.  

#### Hugo

I choose Hugo because it's fast, and I like the simplicity of filling the site content with Markdown.
Having i18n out-of-box also a big advantage of this tool.

#### Github pages
Provides ready to use CI/CD process. Which means my site automatically updates after commit pushed to repository.[^1]

### Costs
It costs my only price of domain kurotych.com
