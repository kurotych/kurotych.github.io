### My engineering philosophy
- **I'm not restricted by my preferences.** There is no ideal programming language or unified tech stack to solve all problems. But there are some technologies that I'd like to work with and some that I would not.
- I believe that good planning and prototyping usually save software development time a lot. Even (or especially) if it is a very early startup. So, **firstly think, investigate, and communicate only then code**.
- Documentation is a must-have to keep informed all development participants.
The phrase: "*Code should be self-documenting*" is about code readability not about documentation.

I use **GNU/Linux** both for work and at home for the whole of my professional career.
I try to use open-source software (where possible).
I didn't touch Windows for years (except sometimes playing video games), and I don't recommend it to anyone.

My favorite language to build something complicated is **Rust** (I also love C, but haven't written anything in a long time).
For script writing, I prefer **Python** or **Bash**.  
**Neovim** as IDE.
