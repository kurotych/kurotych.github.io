I’m a Software Engineer from Ukraine.

I have around 7 years of professional experience in startups and companies with legacy codebases 
where used many different programming languages and technologies.

### My engineering philosophy 
- **I’m not restricted by my preferences.** There is no ideal programming language or unified tech stack to solve all problems. But there are some technologies that I’d like to work with and some that I would not.
- I believe that good planning and prototyping usually save software development time a lot. Even (or especially) if it is a very early startup. So, **firstly think, investigate, and communicate only then code**.
- Documentation is a must-have to keep informed all development participants. 
The phrase *Code should be self-documenting* is about code readability not about documentation.

### A bit about my preferences
I use **GNU/Linux** both for work and at home for the whole of my professional carrier.
Last several years I use open-source software only (except for some drivers).
I didn't touch Windows for years (except sometimes playing video games).

My favorite language to build something complicated is **Rust** (before it was C and C++).  
For script writing, I prefer **Python** or **Bash**.

The **Neovim** as IDE is the best choice.

**I'm not fond** of javascript and typescript and prefer to work with them as little as possible.
